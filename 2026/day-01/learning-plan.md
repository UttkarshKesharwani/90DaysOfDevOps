# 90-Day DevOps Learning Plan

Current level  
I am a fresher with basic Linux and programming experience, determined to transition into DevOps and Cloud Engineering.

Why I'm doing this  
I want to own reliable production systems, automate deployments, and deliver value faster by combining development and operations skills.

3 clear 90-day goals
1. Deploy a full-stack app to a Kubernetes cluster with CI/CD and infra-as-code.  
2. Publish a public portfolio repo and a walkthrough blog post.  
3. Reach interview-ready confidence for entry-level DevOps roles.

3 core DevOps skills to build
- Linux troubleshooting and shell scripting (bash)  
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) and automated testing  
- Kubernetes fundamentals and basic Terraform for infra

Weekly time budget
- Weekdays: 3 hours/day  
- Weekends: 4–6 hours/day  
Estimated total: ~18 hours/week

90-day roadmap (high level)
- Days 1–30: Foundations — Linux, Git, Docker, simple CI.  
- Days 31–60: Build — Containerize app, deploy to Kubernetes, implement CI/CD, start Terraform.  
- Days 61–90: Harden & share — Monitoring, logging, backup, write blog, interview prep.

Daily habit & consistency
- Daily: 30–45 min reading + 60–90 min hands-on.  
- Sunday: 45-min review and plan.  
Accountability: push daily commits and write one-line progress notes in this repo.

Success metrics
- Month 1: CI builds and Docker images published.  
- Month 2: App running on Kubernetes with Terraform-managed infra.  
- Month 3: Monitoring + alerts, public repo + blog, mock interviews complete.

Commitment statement  
I will follow this plan honestly, stay consistent, and deliver one tangible demo every 30 days.
